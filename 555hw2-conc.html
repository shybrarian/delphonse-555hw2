<h1>Conclusion</h1>

Looking at the questionnaires it was interesting to look at the difference in response from
 the user with an information science background and the user with no information science
 background.

<h2>What we agreed on</h2>
<p>Overall, both users and I thought that the system took a long time to learn and that it lacked
 simple instructions that would eliminate this problem. Similarly, the system did not help the
 user avoid mistakes or understand why errors happened. Both users noticed that closing the
 <b>Article View</b> window would freeze a page from time to time, but it was after repeated
 use on my own that I realized this was exclusive to the search results page.
<br>Despite all the problems, we all agreed that it was easy to find interesting material on the
 site. It was truly browseable. We all liked that the <b>Browse</b> and <b>Search</b> functions were distinct. One user even emailed themselves a link to a particulalrly funny article
 so that they could read it again later.</p>

<h2>What we disagreed on</h2>
<p>While I found the animations for certain elements fun -- for instance, the scrolling through the
 years on the <b>Browse</b> page -- one user found them tedious. Upon reflection, I agree that
 for someone doing intense research these animations could get quite annoying since they take up
 some time.</p>
