<h1> Homework 2: System Analysis and Usability Test</h1>

<p>I have evaluated the usability of <a href="http://tower.lib.cua.edu">The Tower Archives</a>.</p>

<p>I discuss the following information on this homepage:</p>

<ol>
	<li>4 inputs and 4 outputs of the system.</li>
	<li>Top 2 strengths and top two weaknesses of the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find my usability test participants' <b>questionnaires</b> and a <b>comparison of results</b> from my usage of the system
and my test participants' use of the system by clicking the links at the top of the page.</p>


<h2>4 Inputs and 4 outputs of the system</h2>

<table style="width:50%">
<tr>
	<th>#</th>
	<th>Input</th>
	<th>Output</th>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>1.</td>
	<td><b>Browse</b> function. Click browse...</td>
	<td>And it will yield a list of years that the user can scroll through. Click on a year
	and the system will display the front page(s) of the available newspaper(s). Click on a
	page to enter the <b>Viewer</b>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>2.</td>
	<td><b>Double click</b> on an article...</td>
	<td>And it will take you to <b>Article View</b>, where you can read an article up close.
	 The user can toggle between <b>Text</b> and <b>Image</b> views of the article -- yielding
	 either a typed transcript of an article of a scanned image of it, respectively. Note that
	 there is no link to the continuation of an article; the user must exit <b>Article View</b>
	 and navigate the newsppaer using the left and right arrows on the screen. Also, when I
	 clicked to <b>Article View</b> from the search results rather than from the <b>Viewer</b>,
	 the webpage would freeze and I would have to start my search all over again.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>3.</td>
	<td><b>Search</b>. Enter your query...</td>
	<td>And a results list will appear, organized by <b>Relevance</b>. There is a blue and gray
	 bar shown by each record to indicate the relative relevance of each. The user can also click
	 on the date of an article to the refine the search (as if they had selected "search in this
	 year only"). Further refinement facets dealing with including or excluding words/phrases,
	 as well as dates, can be found on the left of the results page.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4.</td>
	<td>Click the <b>Envelope</b> button on an article or page...</td>
	<td>And a new window will open prompting you to choose what you'd like to send, then ask for
	 an email address to send it to. This allows users to save links to useful material for themselves
	 or share content with other people. Users also have the option to share content via Twitter
	 or Facebook as well as download articles to their computer. These buttons are symbols, but each
	 features a mouseover instruction to guide the user -- something not seen elsewhere on the site.</td>

<h2>Top 2 strengths and top 2 weaknesses of the system</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<p><b>1. Flexibility and efficiency of use --</b> There are many different view modes
 that users can select, such as <b>Article View</b> and <b>Page View</b> with zoom. This enables
 users to read articles in ways that are most comfortable for their learning style and reading
 preference. A user needing to copy some of the text might prefer the <b>Text</b> version,
 whereas a user looking for a more authentic newspaper experience might prefer to read the
 <b>Image</b> of the article instead.</p>

</p>
<p>In this image: The <b>Article View</b> window as seen when accessed from <b>Page View</v>.

<p><b>2.Immediate Attraction --</b> The <b>Browse</b> function is very visible and very inviting.
 From the first click, it shows images of newspaper front pages and allows for quick navigation of
 years across the top of the page. The quick scrolling animation as the user toggles through the years
 is visually pleasing and gives the sense of flying forward or traveling backward in time to search the
 archive. With the easy-to-access <b>Page View</b>, the user can flip through the pages of a newspaper
 then return to the <b>Browse</b> page to look at more. It is truly browseable, which cannot be said
 about many similar sites.

</p>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<p><b>1. Provide informative feedback --</b> For all of its flexibility in view modes, this
 system does not provide enough information to access these modes. There are no instructions
 for accessing many functions if they are not triggered by an existing button on the screen.
 Some require double clicking or clicking on an element that does not have a text or image
 instruction. Even simple mouseover captions would help guide the user to access these somewhat
 hidden features.
</p>

<p><b>2.Prevent errors and provide simple error recovery --</b> In Input/Output #2, I mention
 that whenever I attempted to access <b>Article View</b> from the search results page rather
 than from the <b>Viewer</b>, the page would freeze. I would then have to refresh the page and
 lose all my search data. In the meantime, the system provided no information about the error,
 how to avoid it, or even how to track my search queries. This lack of memory on behalf of the
 system makes it frustrating for users who are unable to quickly toggle from the search results
 to <b>Article View</b> in order to narrow down the results to find what they need.</p>

 I could scroll down but I could not click on or activate any of the functions on the page.</p>
